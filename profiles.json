Starting off as a graduate historian, I switched to an entirely different discipline: occupational assessor trying to help young people with disabilities to get a job. I’ve just retired and started spending more time on my hobbies, such as singing, reading, and playing volleyball. A group I am a member of is The Texas Vols!",

I am a member of a group called World War Ethusiasts- we recreate and discuss things a war related. Cheers, John",

Climbing never bores me, because each time is different – the routes, the weather, my strength and endurance. It’s great! So I guess most relevantly I am a proud member of Climbing Enthusiasts.",
